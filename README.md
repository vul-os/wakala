## What is Vulos Relay?

Vulos Relay is the **sovereign connectivity fabric** for the VulOS suite — the
single place the suite reaches sovereign, self-hosted boxes across the network
boundary. It ships **two complementary deliverables**:

- **`@vulos/relay-client`** (JS/TS SDK) — wires browser peers together with
  **WebRTC peer-to-peer data channels**, multiplexing signaling, presence, and
  live cursors, and **falling back to a relay circuit** when a direct connection
  can't be established. It's a **client only** — it talks to its host app's
  `/api/peering/*` endpoints for signaling and ICE credentials; TLS is always
  terminated at the edge, so the SDK only ever speaks `https`/`wss`. This powers
  **P2P collaboration** (incl. E2E-encrypted, room-gated document co-editing).

- **A self-hosted Go reverse-tunnel** (`tunnel/` + `cmd/vulos-relayd` +
  `cmd/vulos-relay-agent`) — the **sovereign replacement for `frp` / ngrok /
  Cloudflare Tunnel**. A loopback-bound box dials one outbound `wss://`
  connection to a relay **you control**, which serves a public URL and
  reverse-proxies HTTP + WebSocket back down it — **no inbound ports, no static
  IP, no third-party relay**. The agent can **link to a Vulos account** so its
  usage is metered through Vulos Cloud billing, or run **unlinked and unbilled**
  for pure self-host. This powers **public exposure + cross-instance federation**.

> **Not** the OS app-gateway. Routing `/app/<id>` to a box's local app ports
> (with auth-token injection) is the VulOS shell's own internal reverse proxy —
> a separate concern that stays in the OS. Relay is for crossing the *network*
> boundary (P2P + public exposure), not the in-box one.

## Part of VulOS

**VulOS** is an open, self-hostable web OS + app suite. Each product is
self-hostable on its own, and combined under one login by **Vulos Workspace**:

| Product | What it is |
|---------|------------|
| **Vulos Mail** | Mail + calendar + contacts |
| **Vulos Talk** | Team chat + channels/Spaces + huddles |
| **Vulos Meet** | Video meetings (LiveKit SFU) |
| **Vulos Office** | Documents: docs, sheets, slides, PDF |
| **Vulos Relay** | **← this repo** — sovereign connectivity fabric: `@vulos/relay-client` SDK + a self-hosted Go reverse-tunnel |
| **Vulos Workspace** | The open suite shell (one login, app switcher, admin) |
| **Vulos OS** | The web-native desktop |

**Relay's role:** it is the connectivity fabric the rest of the suite is built
on. The SDK is consumed directly by the VulOS web surfaces — the
[Vulos OS shell](https://github.com/vul-os/vulos),
[Vulos Office](https://github.com/vul-os/vulos-office), and
[Vulos Talk](https://github.com/vul-os/vulos-talk) — to power real-time
collaboration. [Vulos Workspace](https://github.com/vul-os/vulos-workspace)
surfaces Relay as a first-class app in its launcher; it links to and embeds
products but never imports their code, so the seams stay clean.

Relay runs standalone **and** is combined by Vulos Workspace. The client is a
plain npm package with no Vulos-specific runtime dependency — point it at any
backend that implements the peering contract and it works on its own.

## Features

- **P2P fabric sessions** — `FabricClient` opens one `RTCDataChannel`
  (DTLS-SRTP) per remote peer for a given session/document id, with
  polite-peer SDP negotiation (the lexicographically smaller `peerId` defers).
- **Relay fallback** — when a data channel can't be established within 8 s (or a
  live connection fails), the SDK transparently switches that peer to a **relay
  circuit**: messages are deposited and picked up over the host's
  `deposit` / `pickup` / `ack` HTTP API.
- **E2E peer authentication** — each peer mints a per-session **ECDSA P-256**
  key on join, publishes the raw public key in its signaling `join` frame, and
  signs every outgoing `offer`/`answer`/`ice` frame and every relay deposit
  (`to` + `from` + `nonce` + `blob`). The receiving client verifies signatures
  and enforces a signed-timestamp / nonce replay cache before processing any
  frame (`requirePeerAuth: true` by default). The `sdp` field is included in
  the signed material for client-side DTLS fingerprint pinning.
- **Endpoint failover** — `selectEndpoint()` health-probes a cloud and a LAN
  base URL concurrently, prefers LAN-direct for latency, falls back to cloud,
  then same-origin. A 400 ms debounce coalesces Wi-Fi-handoff bursts; failures
  force an immediate re-probe; selections are cached in `localStorage` so
  failover keeps working with the discovery cloud down.
- **Signaling reconnect** — `SignalingClient` rides the host's
  `/api/peering/stream` WebSocket with exponential back-off (1 s → 30 s) and a
  terminal `offline` event after a 10-attempt budget so the UI can show a
  degraded-mode banner. It keeps retrying at max delay, so it self-heals when
  the network returns.
- **Presence** — `PresenceManager` (+ `usePresence` React hook) broadcasts
  multi-peer awareness on a dedicated channel: 10 s heartbeat, 25 s GC, status
  values (`online` / `away` / `dnd` / `in-a-call`), and auto-generated,
  persisted guest identities.
- **Live cursors** — `useLiveCursors` React hook multiplexes carets and
  selections (Docs / Sheets / Slides) on the fabric channel with 80 ms
  pointer-event throttling and token-aware peer colours.
- **P2P mesh calls** — `createCall` for audio/video mesh sessions (the LiveKit
  SFU path was removed before 1.0; the product uses the P2P mesh exclusively).
- **Tree-shakeable subpaths** — import only what you need
  (`@vulos/relay-client/endpoints`, `/fabric`, `/presence`, …); the `xlsx`-using
  `roundTripCheck` is deliberately kept out of the root barrel.
- **Dual build** — ESM (`.js`) + CJS (`.cjs`) bundles with generated `.d.ts`
  types; `react` and `xlsx` are optional peer dependencies.

## Demo

Relay is a headless SDK, so there is **no app UI to screenshot**. Instead, the
repo ships a self-contained **interactive demo** (`demo/index.html`) that drives
the real SDK in the browser with in-process stub peers — no backend or
credentials required. The screenshotter renders it to PNGs:

| | |
|---|---|
| ![Demo harness](docs/screenshots/hero.png) | ![Signaling + relay flow](docs/screenshots/architecture.png) |
| Endpoint failover + fabric/presence panels | Signaling & relay-fallback sequence |

Regenerate with `npm run screenshots` (Playwright). See
[docs/SCREENSHOTS.md](docs/SCREENSHOTS.md).

---

## Quick start (standalone)

`@vulos/relay-client` is a plain npm package — install it on its own, point it
at any backend that implements the peering contract, and use it without the rest
of VulOS.

```bash
npm install @vulos/relay-client
```

`react` and `xlsx` are **optional** peer dependencies — install them only if you
use the React hooks (`usePresence`, `useLiveCursors`) or the `roundTripCheck`
subpath.

A minimal fabric session with presence. All exports below are verified against
`client/src` — `FabricClient` and `PresenceManager` extend `EventTarget`, so you
subscribe with `addEventListener`.

```js
import { selectEndpoint }  from '@vulos/relay-client/endpoints'
import { FabricClient }    from '@vulos/relay-client/fabric'
import { PresenceManager } from '@vulos/relay-client/presence'

// 1. Pick the best reachable backend (LAN-direct → cloud → same-origin).
const base = await selectEndpoint()

// 2. Open a fabric session for a document/room id.
const fabric = new FabricClient({
  sessionId:    'doc-abc123',
  peerId:       currentUser.id,
  signalingUrl: `${base.replace(/^http/, 'ws')}/api/peering/stream`,
  iceUrl:       `${base}/api/peering/ice`,   // optional; this is the default path
  authToken:    session.jwt,                 // optional Bearer JWT
})

// 3. Receive application messages (e.g. CRDT ops) from peers.
fabric.addEventListener('message', ({ detail: { from, data } }) => {
  console.log('message from', from, data)
})

// 4. Track per-peer connection state: connecting | connected | relay | disconnected
fabric.addEventListener('state', ({ detail: { peerId, state } }) => {
  console.log(peerId, '→', state)
})

await fabric.join()
fabric.send(JSON.stringify({ op: 'insert', pos: 0, text: 'hello' })) // broadcast
// fabric.sendTo(peerId, payload)  // unicast to one peer

// 5. Layer presence on top of the fabric.
const presence = new PresenceManager({
  fabric,
  localIdentity: { accountId: currentUser.id, displayName: currentUser.name },
})
presence.addEventListener('roster', ({ detail: roster }) => console.log(roster))
presence.join()
```

In React, prefer the hooks:

```jsx
import { usePresence }    from '@vulos/relay-client/presence'
import { useLiveCursors } from '@vulos/relay-client/useLiveCursors'

const { roster, manager } = usePresence({ fabric, localIdentity })
const { remoteCursors, broadcastDocCursor } =
  useLiveCursors({ fabric, localIdentity, color })
```

Inside the VulOS monorepo, consumers use a `file:` dependency instead of the
published package:

```jsonc
// package.json
"@vulos/relay-client": "file:../vulos-relay/client"
```

To explore the SDK with **zero setup**, build the client and open the
interactive demo (it imports the built bundle directly — no backend needed):

```bash
cd client && npm ci && npm run build   # produces client/dist-lib/
npm run screenshots                    # or just open demo/index.html in a browser
```

> The endpoint layer also exposes `configure({ lsKeyPrefix, healthPath })` so a
> surface can preserve its existing `localStorage` cache and point the health
> probe at its own auth endpoint. See [`client/README.md`](client/README.md) for
> the full subpath map.

## Architecture

A fabric session moves through six phases:

1. **Join** — fetch ICE/TURN servers (`/api/peering/ice`, falling back to the
   cloud `/api/turn/credentials`) and open the signaling WebSocket.
2. **Signaling** — `SignalingClient` multiplexes `join` / `offer` / `answer` /
   `ice` / `leave` frames over the `signal` channel of the host's
   `/api/peering/stream` socket, addressed per session and per peer.
3. **SDP + ICE** — each peer pair negotiates an `RTCPeerConnection`
   (polite/impolite roles decided by `peerId` ordering) and exchanges ICE
   candidates.
4. **P2P data channel** — application traffic flows over a single
   `RTCDataChannel` (`vulos-office-fabric`) per peer.
5. **Relay fallback** — if a channel can't open within `RELAY_TIMEOUT_MS` (8 s),
   or fails later, that peer flips to `relay`: messages are signed and
   **deposited**, then **polled** back via the host's relay HTTP API.
6. **Presence + cursors** — `PresenceManager` and `useLiveCursors` ride
   dedicated `presence` and `cursors` channels on the same fabric, each with
   their own heartbeat / throttle.

    participant A as Peer A
    participant Hub as Signaling Hub

    participant Relay
    A->>Hub: join (sessionId)
    B->>Hub: join (sessionId)
    A->>Hub: offer (SDP)
    Hub->>B: offer (SDP)
    B->>Hub: answer (SDP)
    Hub->>A: answer (SDP)
    A-->>B: ICE candidates (concurrent, via hub)
    A->>B: RTCDataChannel (P2P, bidirectional)
    Note over A,B: if P2P fails within 8 s → relay circuit (HTTP)
    A->>Relay: deposit (signed)
    Relay->>B: pickup (poll)
```

**Transport stack.** This SDK is built on the browser's native primitives —
`RTCPeerConnection` / `RTCDataChannel` for P2P, `WebSocket` for signaling, and
`fetch` for ICE credentials and relay deposit/pickup. The SDK itself has no
proxy/tunnel layer; its relay circuit is a plain authenticated HTTP
store-and-forward served by the host backend. (The repo's separate **Go
reverse-tunnel** — see below — is a distinct subsystem for public exposure, not
part of the SDK's transport.)

**TLS termination.** The SDK only ever talks to the base URL it selected, over
`https`/`wss`. TLS is terminated at the edge — a cloud POP for cloud-routed
installs, or the box itself for LAN-direct — never inside this client.

See [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) for the full layer-by-layer
design.

---

## Configuration

The SDK is configured through `FabricClient` / `PresenceManager` constructor
options and the `configure()` seam on the endpoint layer (localStorage key
prefix, health path). The full list of options — endpoint discovery sources,
constructor params, and tunables (timeouts, heartbeat, throttle) — is documented
in [docs/CONFIGURATION.md](docs/CONFIGURATION.md).

---

## Sovereign reverse tunnel (Go)

Alongside the JS SDK, this repo ships a **self-hosted reverse tunnel** that lets a
loopback-bound Vulos box publish itself on the public internet with **no inbound
ports, no static IP, and no third-party relay** — it replaces external `frp` with
our own sovereign server.

The box runs an **agent** that dials a **single outbound `wss://`** connection to a
**relay server you control**; the relay serves a public URL
(`https://<name>.<relay-domain>`, or `/t/<name>/` without wildcard DNS) and reverse-
proxies inbound HTTP + WebSocket traffic back down that one connection via
[`hashicorp/yamux`](https://github.com/hashicorp/yamux). It is built to run
internet-facing:

- **Bearer-token agent auth** — constant-time compare, tokens stored hashed.
- **Token-bound names** — a token may serve only its granted name(s); a live name is
  held by exactly one session and cannot be hijacked.
- **SSRF guard** — the agent forwards only to its one configured loopback target;
  non-loopback targets are refused at startup and re-checked at dial time.
- **Rate limiting** — per-source-IP control-connection, per-tunnel, and global
  request token buckets, all returning `429` (memory-bounded, idle-evicted).
- **Over-quota cut** — an account past its billing cap is cut with `402`.
- **Token / credential revocation** — a file/env revoked-list plus a runtime revoke
  API; revoked credentials are refused at connect and any live tunnel is dropped by a
  periodic revocation sweep.
- **Direct-IP fast path (optional)** — a box with a public IP can advertise a direct
  `https://` endpoint; the relay **verifies it** (reachable + ownership-proven by a
  nonce echo, SSRF-guarded, only after auth) before clients dial it **directly** for
  near-native latency, falling back to the relay tunnel on any failure. NAT'd/CGNAT
  boxes stay on the always-works relay path. See [docs/TUNNEL.md](docs/TUNNEL.md).
- **Bounds** — max agents, max streams/agent, request header/body caps, and
  keepalive dead-peer detection keep memory bounded.
- **Observability** — a dependency-free Prometheus `/metrics` endpoint plus
  `/healthz` / `/readyz` on a **separate loopback/token-gated admin listener** (never
  on the public tunnel), with bounded-cardinality labels and structured `slog`
  logging that never emits a token/secret.

```bash
# relay server. Serves the public tunnel on -addr; serves /metrics + /healthz +
# /readyz on a SEPARATE admin listener (default 127.0.0.1:9090, loopback-only).
go run ./cmd/vulos-relayd -domain relay.example.com \
  -tokens-file grants.json            # [{"token":"SECRET1","names":["box1"]}]

# box-side agent (binds nothing inbound; forwards only to -local)
go run ./cmd/vulos-relay-agent -server wss://relay.example.com \
  -token SECRET1 -name box1 -local 127.0.0.1:8080
```

The `tunnel/agent` package mirrors wede's `internal/tunnel.Manager`
(`Start`/`Stop`/`PublicURL`/`Snapshot`, same `stopped`/`starting`/`connected`/`error`
vocabulary) so it can be embedded in-process — [wede](https://github.com/vul-os/wede)
uses it directly in place of external `frpc`.

**Account-linking + usage metering (optional).** An OSS/self-host install can
**link to a Vulos account** — a headless device-code flow
(`/api/link/device/{start,approve,poll}`) mints an account-bound credential — after
which the relay server resolves each agent to its account, gates it on the
account's tier/quota (`GET /api/relay/entitlement`), and flushes per-account byte
deltas to Vulos Cloud billing (`POST /api/relay/usage`, HMAC-signed + idempotent).
Entitlement fails **closed** at connect and **open** mid-session (a billing blip
never cuts a live tunnel). A static grant with **no** account runs **unlinked and
unbilled** — pure sovereign self-host needs no Vulos account; linking is opt-in.
Run `vulos-relayd` with `-cp-url` / `-cp-shared-secret` / `-pop-id` to enable it.

## Development

The publishable package lives in `client/`. The repository root holds dev
tooling (e.g. screenshot capture) under `scripts/`.

```bash
cd client
npm ci
npm run build   # Vite lib build (ESM + CJS) + tsc .d.ts generation
npm test        # Vitest (jsdom)
```

Tests run under Vitest with jsdom; the SDK targets browser environments
(`WebSocket`, `RTCPeerConnection`, `BroadcastChannel`, `crypto.subtle`).

CI ([`.github/workflows/ci.yml`](.github/workflows/ci.yml)) builds and tests the
client on Node 20, then runs a Trivy filesystem scan (HIGH/CRITICAL gating).

### Release

Releases are cut by tagging. The
[release workflow](.github/workflows/release.yml) builds, tests, verifies the
tag matches `client/package.json`, and publishes to npm with OIDC provenance.

```bash
# bump version in client/package.json first, then:
git tag v1.2.3 && git push origin v1.2.3
```

---

## Security

### Peer authentication and frame signing

Every `FabricClient` session generates an ephemeral **ECDSA P-256** key pair.
The public key is published in the signaling `join` frame (`depositPubKey`) and
every outgoing `offer`, `answer`, and `ice` frame is signed over its canonical
JSON form (fixed key order: `from`, `nonce`, `sdp`/`candidate`, `pubKey`).

By default (`requirePeerAuth: true`), the SDK **rejects unsigned frames** from
peers whose key it has not yet imported. A peer that joins with a signed frame
carrying an inline `pubKey` is accepted (TOFU — Trust on First Use); subsequent
frames must be signed with the same key. Frames whose `(from, nonce)` pair has
already been seen are silently dropped (bounded per-session replay cache, 1000
entries, FIFO eviction).

The `sdp` field is mirrored into the signed payload so a MITM that rewrites the
SDP (and its DTLS fingerprint) after the sender has signed it will produce a
signature that fails verification — providing a client-side DTLS fingerprint
pinning guarantee independent of the signaling transport.

Relay blobs are verified the same way: each deposit carries `{ to, from, nonce,
blob_b64 }` in the signed material, and a blob arriving without a signature from
a peer whose key is known is dropped.

To opt out of peer auth for legacy deployments (e.g. where the remote peer does
not sign frames), pass `requirePeerAuth: false` to `FabricClient`. For the call
path (`networkSession` in `@vulos/relay-client/call`), per-session signing is
wired automatically with `requirePeerAuth: false` on the call signaling client —
call peers rely on DTLS-SRTP for media security while the signaling data is still
signed.

The `Vulos-Relay: <peerId>` header is not sent unless you explicitly pass
`allowUnsignedRelayAuth: true` — this header can be forged by any client and is
not a security mechanism.
