//! # broker-billing
//!
//! The CONTRACT §6 economics, made concrete: metering, tariff evaluation, signed usage receipts,
//! and a pluggable no-token settlement seam — built on top of the real signed
//! [`broker_economics::Tariff`]/[`broker_economics::UsageReceipt`] types from W3
//! (`broker-economics/src/descriptor.rs`). This crate does not reinvent signing, canonical CBOR,
//! or identity: it reuses `broker-economics`/`kotva-core` throughout and adds the *policy* layer
//! CONTRACT §6 leaves to the operator — metering, a concrete tariff-schedule shape, and a
//! settlement/stake seam.
//!
//! ## Module map
//! - [`meter`] — kind-agnostic usage counting per payer ([`meter::ResourceKind`], [`meter::Meter`],
//!   [`meter::InMemoryMeter`]).
//! - [`tariff`] — a concrete [`tariff::TariffSchedule`] shape built via
//!   `broker_economics::Cbor::from_cv`, and [`tariff::TariffSchedule::evaluate`] turning usage
//!   into an itemized [`tariff::Bill`].
//! - [`pricing`] — **USD recommended pricing**: [`pricing::HostingProfile`] (an operator's real
//!   infra costs) and [`pricing::recommended_tariff`], a cost-plus starting-point
//!   [`tariff::TariffSchedule`] per coordinator kind. Loudly a recommendation, never a mandate —
//!   §6 keeps the actual numbers operator policy.
//! - [`prepaid`] — **the primary billing model** (see `DECISIONS.md`): [`prepaid::PrepaidLedger`]
//!   top-up/debit/refund credit accounting, [`prepaid::BillingState`], and wiring debits straight
//!   into a signed [`receipt::ReceiptLog`] entry. Custody-free by construction — see the module
//!   doc.
//! - [`subscription`] — an OPTIONAL, secondary monthly postpaid policy
//!   ([`subscription::Subscription`]), riding the same [`settlement::SettlementRail`] as
//!   everything else.
//! - [`sim`] — [`sim::BillingEvent`]/[`sim::SimEngine`]: a deterministic simulated event stream
//!   (`TopUp`, `MeteredUsage`, `TariffChange`, `LowBalance`, `Refund`, `MonthlyCharge`) driving
//!   the real meter/tariff/prepaid/receipt/settlement pipeline for tests.
//! - [`receipt`] — issuing signed [`broker_economics::UsageReceipt`]s for a [`tariff::Bill`]
//!   ([`receipt::ReceiptLog`]), and — importantly — the documented **one-directional audit**
//!   residual (CONTRACT §6, R-6): read `receipt`'s module doc before treating "receipts verify"
//!   as "billing is honest."
//! - [`settlement`] — the [`settlement::SettlementRail`] trait (charge/settle in an *existing*
//!   asset — no token, ever) plus the one reference adapter, [`settlement::InMemoryLedger`], which
//!   is explicitly a mock. A real, optional adapter over this trait lives in the sibling
//!   `broker-billing-patala` crate (a Stellar-backed prepaid top-up rail) — never a dependency of
//!   this crate.
//! - [`stake`] — the [`stake::StakeVerifier`] seam for staked kinds (`arbiter`, `oracle`), with
//!   the CONTRACT §6 fail-closed default ([`stake::NoStakeRail`]): an unverifiable stake claim
//!   MUST be treated as no stake.
//!
//! ## Prepaid is primary; monthly postpaid is optional
//!
//! CONTRACT §2.2 (zero lock-in), §2.4/SEC-7 (anonymous-but-accountable anti-abuse), and §6
//! (signed usage receipts against metered usage) together point at **prepaid top-up credit
//! metered against usage** as the model that best fits this crate's own constraints — see
//! [`prepaid`]'s module doc for the full rationale. [`subscription::Subscription`] (fixed monthly
//! postpaid) exists because an operator MAY still offer it, not because it is preferred; both
//! ride the exact same [`settlement::SettlementRail`] seam, so there is never a second money path
//! to keep in sync.
//!
//! ## What this crate is, and is not
//! This is a **model + seams**: real, testable metering/tariff/receipt/ledger logic, wired to the
//! real signing primitives — not a live payment integration. [`settlement::InMemoryLedger`] never
//! talks to a chain or a payment processor; [`settlement::PaymentRequired`]/`PaymentProof` are
//! data shapes for an x402-style HTTP 402 challenge, not an HTTP server or a facilitator client;
//! [`stake::NoStakeRail`] never queries a chain. Every one of those is a `trait` a real,
//! operator-supplied adapter implements. See each module's doc for the specific honesty
//! disclosure.
//!
//! No protocol token exists anywhere in this crate, by construction: every amount is
//! denominated in a caller-supplied currency/asset string (DIRECTION §5), never a Wakala-minted
//! unit, and [`meter`]/[`tariff`] never produce or consume anything resembling one.
