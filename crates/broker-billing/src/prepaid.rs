//! Prepaid credit — the **primary** billing model (founder decision, see `DECISIONS.md`): a
//! payer tops up credit ahead of use, and metered usage is debited against that credit as it
//! accrues. CONTRACT §6 / DIRECTION §5.
//!
//! ## Why prepaid is primary
//!
//! - **Zero lock-in** (CONTRACT §2.2): a prepaid balance is just a number a payer can stop
//!   adding to; there is no standing agreement to unwind, no invoice to cancel, no credit check
//!   to fail. Switching coordinators costs nothing but the unspent balance, which
//!   [`PrepaidLedger::refund`] can hand back.
//! - **Anonymous-but-accountable** (CONTRACT §4's allowed anti-abuse list, SEC-7): a prepaid
//!   balance is exactly a "postage" token — it does not require binding a payer's real-world
//!   identity to a monthly billing relationship the way a subscription/card-on-file does.
//! - **Matches the metering model** (§6): usage is metered continuously; debiting continuously
//!   against a standing balance is the natural match, rather than accumulating an unbounded tab
//!   an operator must then collect after the fact.
//!
//! ## Ephor holds no funds — "credit claims," not custody
//!
//! [`PrepaidLedger`] is bookkeeping only. [`PrepaidLedger::top_up`] credits a balance because the
//! caller asserts a `funding_ref` — a pointer to whatever ALREADY happened on a real
//! [`crate::settlement::SettlementRail`] (a deposit, a verified on-rail receipt reference; see
//! `crates/broker-billing-patala` for a real adapter that only calls this after independently
//! verifying a rail receipt). This type never receives, holds, or moves money itself — exactly
//! the same non-custodial split `crate::settlement`'s module doc describes for
//! [`crate::settlement::InMemoryLedger`], and exactly what "patala holds no funds, takes no cut"
//! means for the reference rail adapter. A caller who calls `top_up` without first confirming the
//! funding actually landed is the one taking on risk — this type cannot protect against that any
//! more than [`crate::receipt::ReceiptLog`] can protect against a fabricated receipt (see that
//! module's one-directional-audit doc); it is disclosed here for the same reason.
