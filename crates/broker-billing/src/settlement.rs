//! The settlement seam — charging a [`Bill`](crate::tariff::Bill) against an **existing** asset
//! (CONTRACT §6, DIRECTION §5).
//!
//! ## The no-token invariant
//!
//! Ephor/KOTVA mints nothing. There is no protocol token anywhere in this crate, and
//! [`SettlementRail`] is written so there structurally cannot be one smuggled in: it charges an
//! amount denominated in a caller-supplied `currency` string (an ISO 4217 code or an existing
//! stablecoin ticker — whatever [`crate::tariff::TariffSchedule::currency`] says), never in an
//! Ephor-defined unit. Custody and canonical settlement of that asset are **entirely the rail
//! implementation's problem** — a real chain client, a card processor, a bank-transfer API — none
//! of which lives in this crate. Ephor brokers none of it and takes no cut (DIRECTION §5,
//! CONTRACT §6).
//!
//! ## What's real here vs. what's a seam
//!
//! [`SettlementRail`] is the trait a real adapter implements. [`InMemoryLedger`] is the ONE
//! reference implementation in this crate — an in-memory double-entry ledger, clearly a mock: it
//! settles nothing outside the process, has no persistence, and is unsuitable for anything but
//! tests/demos. [`PaymentRequired`]/[`PaymentProof`] are data shapes only — an x402-style
//! (HTTP 402 "Payment Required") challenge/response, per the family of HTTP-native payment
//! bindings the ecosystem is converging on — provided so a coordinator's admin/HTTP surface (W7)
//! has a documented shape to embed, **not** a live x402 facilitator/client integration (no HTTP
//! server, no signature scheme for the payment proof itself is implemented here).
