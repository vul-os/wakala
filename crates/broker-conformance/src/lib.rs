//! # broker-conformance
//!
//! The coordinator-contract conformance harness: the [`Coordinator`] trait every
//! Ephor kind implements, and [`check`], which runs the COORD-1..8 checklist of
//! `coordinator/CONTRACT.md` §7 against it.
//!
//! Honesty rule (STYLE §8): some clauses are decidable from the descriptor and the
//! kind's declared posture; others are **behavioral** — a coordinator that *declares*
//! blind but *operates* terminating (COORD-5) can only be caught against real
//! traffic. The harness marks those [`Outcome::Behavioral`] rather than falsely
//! passing them, and the per-kind runtime conformance tests discharge them.
