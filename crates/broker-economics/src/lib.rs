//! # broker-economics
//!
//! The shared model every Ephor coordinator kind is built on: the
//! **content-visibility** property (a checkable class × assurance level), the
//! **coordinator kinds** table, and the discovery-only **descriptor / tariff /
//! usage-receipt** shapes — the machinery of `coordinator/CONTRACT.md` §2–§6.
//!
//! The point of the whole broker contract is that "some centralization, done
//! safely" is a *checkable property*, not a hope. This crate is where that
//! property is made into types: a coordinator declares exactly one
//! [`ContentVisibility`], the crate says when that declaration is
//! [verifiable](AssuranceLevel::is_verifiable) and when it MUST NOT be presented as
//! verified, and a [`Descriptor`] structurally cannot carry a global score, a price
//! rank, or a stake field.
//!
//! Substrate-typed parts — signing, deterministic CBOR, the real descriptor bytes —
//! ride the tag-pinned `kotva-core` (`core-v0.2.0`, HANDOVER §Guardrails-1): see
//! [`descriptor`] for the signing/verification API and the wire layout. This crate
//! re-exports [`kotva_core::identity::IdentityKey`] at the top level as
//! [`IdentityKey`] so consumers construct real identities without a separate
//! `kotva-core` dependency of their own.
//!
//! ## Honest limits
//! This crate makes a visibility declaration **checkable**; it does not itself **prove** a
//! coordinator's runtime matches what it declares. Whether observed behavior agrees with a
//! declared [`ContentVisibility`] (CONTRACT §3, COORD-5) is a per-kind, per-implementation
//! question — see `broker-conformance`'s `Outcome::Behavioral` and each kind crate's own
//! `tests/conformance_runtime.rs` where one exists (`gateway`, `reachability-adapter` today).
