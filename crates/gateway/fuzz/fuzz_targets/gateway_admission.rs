use gateway::authz::{AdmissionError, IdentityRegistry};

// **Relocated from envoir** (`fuzz/fuzz_targets/gateway_admission.rs`, removed by envoir commit
// `620a68c` when the gateway moved to Ephor) and retargeted at the real, current `gateway` crate:
// `envoir_gateway::authz::{AdmissionError, IdentityRegistry}` → `gateway::authz::{AdmissionError,
// IdentityRegistry}`. The API shape is unchanged (same method names, same fail-closed error
// variants), so the property and the harness below are otherwise the original, unmodified logic.
//
// The gateway's challenge–response admission (§7.9, §9, `gateway`'s `authz` module):
// `IdentityRegistry::admit` is called with a **presented key** and a **signature**, both fully
// attacker-controlled bytes over the wire (a connecting SMTP client presents whatever it wants) —
// `admit` hands them straight to `kotva-core`'s `verify_domain`, which parses the key bytes into an
// Ed25519 verifying key and the signature bytes into an Ed25519 signature before checking anything.
// This is exactly the "parse untrusted bytes before any signature is trusted" attack surface, just
// at the gateway-admission boundary instead of a CBOR decoder.
//
// Property checked: for ANY `presented_key`/`sig` byte strings, against a fixed challenge, `admit`
// must never panic — it must always return one of the documented, fail-closed [`AdmissionError`]
// variants (or, for the vanishingly unlikely case the fuzzer forges a byte-identical valid
// signature, `Ok`), never crash or hang.
fuzz_target!(|data: &[u8]| {
    if data.is_empty() {
        return;
    }
    // First byte picks where to split the rest of `data` into the presented key and the signature —
    // both fully attacker-controlled, exercising every possible pairing and every possible length
    // (including 0, 1, and far-too-long, all of which a real Ed25519 parse must reject cleanly).
    let (split_byte, rest) = data.split_at(1);
    let split = (split_byte[0] as usize) % (rest.len() + 1);
    let (presented_key, sig) = rest.split_at(split);

    // A registry with nothing registered (so a key-registered-mode admit can only ever reach
    // `UnknownKey` past a valid signature — irrelevant to this property, but keeps the harness
    // deterministic) plus a fixed challenge and admission time. The clock/nonce are not the
    // attacker-controlled surface here (production draws the nonce from the OS CSPRNG); only the
    // presented key and signature are.
    let reg = IdentityRegistry::key_registered();
    let challenge = reg.issue_challenge([0x11; 32], 1_000_000);
