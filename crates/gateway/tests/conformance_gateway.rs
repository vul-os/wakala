//! DMTAP §7 gateway-conformance cases relocated from envoir.
//!
//! **Provenance.** These cases originally lived as `construction-todo` drivers in envoir's
//! `crates/conformance-runner/src/construction.rs`, executed against `envoir_gateway` (the
//! `dmtap-core`-flavored predecessor of this crate). Wave W1 (envoir commit `620a68c`, "envoir:
//! node-only — drop the gateway + its conformance/fuzz coverage; consume kotva-core@tag") removed
//! both the gateway crate and its conformance/fuzz coverage from envoir, since the gateway itself
//! moved here, to Ephor's `gateway` crate. Wave W2 (this file) retrieves those cases from envoir's
//! git history (`620a68c^`) and re-homes them here, driven against the REAL, current ephor
//! `gateway` public API (not a copy or a stub) — `kotva_core` in place of `dmtap_core`, `gateway::`
//! in place of `envoir_gateway::`, and each case's calls updated wherever the API surface drifted
//! (see the per-case doc comment below for what changed, if anything). The §7 spec citations in
//! each case's doc comment are preserved from the original.
//!
//! **What did NOT come along**, and why (see the module docs of `crates/gateway/src/attestation.rs`
//! / `src/provenance.rs` for the current shape):
//!
//! - `DMTAP-GWATT-04` ("a high-value-recipient policy requires the KT-anchored attestation form"):
//!   this was *already* a documented **skip**, not an executable case, in envoir's own
//!   `construction.rs` — envoir-gateway's attestation/provenance modules modeled exactly one
//!   assurance tier (a flat DNS-published `_dmtap-gw` key), with no KT-anchored second tier and no
//!   "high-value recipient" policy concept to select between. Ephor's `gateway::attestation` /
//!   `gateway::provenance` modules inherited that same single-tier design (one DNS-published
//!   `_dmtap-gw` key, verified via `Attestation::verify` / `GatewayAttestation::verify`) — there is
//!   still no second, KT-anchored verification path to construct this case against, so it stays a
//!   documented non-case here too rather than a faked pass.
//!
//! Everything else in the relocated set (`DMTAP-GWALIAS-01/02`, `DMTAP-GWATT-05`,
//! `DMTAP-GWNAME-02`, `DMTAP-LEG-01/02/03`) maps cleanly onto the current API — in most cases the
//! call shapes are unchanged (`gateway::provenance::GatewayAttestation::{sign,verify}`,
//! `gateway::provenance::chain_append`, `gateway::outbound::OutboundGateway::{translate_and_sign,
//! send_authenticated}`, `gateway::outbound_guard::OutboundSenderGuard`, `gateway::authz::
//! AliasAllocator`, `gateway::alias_map::GatewayAliasMap`, `gateway::forwarded_addr::{encode,
//! decode}` are the same names doing the same job); the one real rename is envoir's flat
//! `envoir_gateway::attestation::Attestation` verify signature (`domain, key, rfc5322_bytes`) vs.
//! ephor's `gateway::attestation::Attestation::verify` (`expected_domain, published_key,
//! wrapped_mote_id: &ContentId`) — the §7.2a attestation here binds to the wrapped MOTE's content
//! address rather than to raw legacy bytes directly, so `DMTAP-LEG-01` below binds against a
//! `ContentId` instead of an `&[u8]`.
