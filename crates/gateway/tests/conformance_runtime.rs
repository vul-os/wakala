//! Wave W10 — runtime conformance tests that DISCHARGE the `broker_conformance` Behavioral
//! findings for the `gateway` kind (COORD-1 and COORD-5, coordinator/CONTRACT.md §3/§4), plus a
//! COORD-6 runtime demonstration.
//!
//! `broker_conformance::check()` marks COORD-1 ("verify descriptor signature once kotva-core is
//! pinned") and COORD-5 ("assert observed TLS/behavior matches the declared visibility class") as
//! `Outcome::Behavioral` — not decidable from the descriptor alone, and explicitly deferred to
//! per-kind runtime tests (`crates/broker-conformance/src/lib.rs` module docs, STYLE §8). This
//! file is that runtime test for `gateway`. `kotva-core` is now tag-pinned (W3), so COORD-1's
//! signature is real cryptography here, not a stub.
//!
//! Every test below states what it proves AND what it does **not** (KOTVA house style,
//! coordinator/CONTRACT.md §4): the honest residuals are left visible, never quietly assumed away.
