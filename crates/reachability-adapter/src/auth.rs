//! REACH-2 — mutual key-authentication of the box↔adapter control connection
//! to the box's real identity key (`IK`), mirroring DMTAP-Auth's
//! challenge-response ceremony (kotva `13-identity-auth.md` §13.3) applied to
//! a node-held key rather than a browser/WebAuthn login:
//!
//! ```text
//! box -> adapter   AuthAnnounce { claimed_ik, name, allowed_services }
//! adapter -> box   Challenge { nonce }                    (fresh, single-use)
//! box -> adapter   Response { sig }     sig = Sign_ik(DS ‖ nonce ‖ name)
//! ```
//!
//! The adapter verifies `sig` against the box's own *claimed* `claimed_ik`
//! via [`kotva_core::identity::verify_domain`]. On success the box has proven
//! — with the same confidence as any Ed25519 signature — that it holds the
//! private key for `claimed_ik`, and [`TunnelRegistry`](crate::tunnel::TunnelRegistry)
//! binds the SNI registration to that authenticated key (`tunnel.rs`). On any
//! failure (malformed frame, unknown/already-consumed nonce, bad signature)
//! this module fails closed: the caller MUST drop the connection without
//! proceeding to the yamux session (REACH-6 applied to the control leg).
//!
//! Binding the signature to `nonce ‖ name` (not just `nonce`) is what stops a
//! signature obtained for one name from being lifted to register a different
//! one: an attacker who somehow captures a valid `(nonce, sig)` pair for
//! `alice.reach.example` cannot replay it to claim `bob.reach.example` — the
//! preimage would not match, so [`verify_domain`] rejects it.
//!
//! ## Replay-inertness
//!
//! The nonce is drawn from the OS CSPRNG ([`getrandom`]) fresh per
//! connection, and [`NonceRegistry`] marks it **consumed exactly once**
//! ([`NonceRegistry::consume`]) the instant a `Response` frame is read — a
//! second presentation of the same nonce bytes, from any connection, is
//! rejected as [`AuthError::NonceReplayed`]. In the ordinary case this is
//! belt-and-suspenders (a fresh per-connection nonce already makes a captured
//! signature useless against any *other* connection's differently-nonced
//! challenge, since the preimage differs); the registry closes the
//! degenerate case of a nonce value being issued twice (an RNG defect, or a
//! future refactor that stops drawing fresh nonces per connection) rather
//! than relying on "the RNG never repeats" alone.
//!
//! ## What REACH-2 this closes, and what it does not (honest disclosure)
//!
//! **Closed:** mutual **key-authentication** — the adapter never accepts a
//! registration it cannot cryptographically attribute to a specific `IK`,
//! and (`tunnel.rs`) a name once registered to one `IK` can never be
//! hijacked or silently overwritten by a different `IK` (REACH-7-style
//! single-writer, now scoped to `(name, owning IK)` instead of bare `name`).
//! Wrong-key signatures, replayed nonces, and cross-name signature reuse all
//! fail closed.
//!
//! **NOT closed — the residual, stated plainly:** this is key-auth **only**.
//! The handshake frames (`AuthAnnounce`, `Challenge`, `Response`) — and every
//! byte on the control connection after them, including the yamux session
//! itself — travel over the **same plain, unencrypted TCP connection**
//! `tunnel.rs` always used. There is no Noise/TLS wrapper here. The REACH
//! profile's long-term target for this leg is **libp2p Noise**
//! (profiles/reachability.md §2, "a libp2p-secured stream"); that transport-
//! security layer is still **not implemented** by this crate. Concretely, an
//! on-path attacker between box and adapter can:
//!
//! - **observe** every frame — the claimed public `IK`, the registered name,
//!   the service allow-list, the nonce, and the signature — none of this is
//!   confidential on the wire;
//! - **tamper with or drop** frames — a MITM can flip, truncate, or delay
//!   bytes, forcing a handshake failure (denial of service on that
//!   connection attempt);
//!
//! but such an attacker **cannot forge a valid signature** for an `IK` it
//! does not hold the private key for, so it **cannot impersonate the box**,
//! cannot register a name under an identity it does not own, and cannot
//! splice a captured signature onto a different nonce or name. What key-auth
//! alone buys is exactly that: proof of identity, not confidentiality or
//! tamper-detection of the channel carrying it. Do not present this module,
//! or the crate, as "fully REACH-2 compliant" — REACH-2 mandates the tunnel
//! be mutually authenticated **over** a libp2p-Noise-secured transport, and
//! only the authentication half is done here.
//!
//! REACH-5's allow-list continues to ride the same free-form-string
//! declaration inside the (now authenticated) [`Registration`] — REACH-2
//! proves *who* is declaring it, not that the declared services are
//! independently verified against anything external; that remains future
//! work, unaffected by this module.
