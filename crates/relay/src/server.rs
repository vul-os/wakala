//! The libp2p relay **server**: a Circuit Relay v2 (RFC-less libp2p spec, `libp2p::relay`)
//! forwarder for NAT'd mesh peers (CONTRACT §5 `relay` row).
//!
//! ## Why this is content-blind by construction
//!
//! A Circuit Relay v2 server forwards **opaque byte streams between two already-Noise-secured
//! libp2p connections**: peer A dials the relay, peer B has a standing reservation on the same
//! relay, and the relay simply splices A's substream to B's substream. Both substreams carry
//! Noise-encrypted (and, above that, the application's own end-to-end-encrypted) bytes — the
//! relay's `relay::Behaviour` never terminates the Noise session running *inside* the relayed
//! circuit (that session is between A and B, not A-relay or relay-B) and holds no key that could
//! decrypt it. This is `blind`/`structural` per `coordinator/CONTRACT.md` §3.3: the role *has no
//! key*, not merely a promise not to look — the strongest, provable assurance level. See the
//! crate root docs for the (deliberately fenced) `reachability-adapter` comparison.
//!
//! ## What is wired
//!
//! - **Transport:** TCP, secured by **Noise**, multiplexed by **Yamux** — the same transport-
//!   security stack envoir's `dmtap-p2p` mesh transport runs (matched libp2p major/minor +
//!   feature shape, BUILD-PLAN.md W5), so an ephor relay and an envoir/dmtap-p2p mesh node
//!   interoperate on the wire.
//! - **[`relay`](libp2p::relay) (Circuit Relay v2), server role only:** this crate is a relay,
//!   never a relay *client* — it does not reserve slots on other relays or dial peers through
//!   one. (Contrast dmtap-p2p, whose *mesh nodes* run both roles because a mesh node is
//!   sometimes the NAT'd party needing relay service and sometimes the public node serving it.)
//! - **[`identify`](libp2p::identify):** required in practice for Circuit Relay v2 to work at
//!   all — a relay client verifies the relay's identity and observed address through it.
//!
//! ## Async containment
//!
//! libp2p is async (tokio); [`RelayServer`] contains that runtime internally (its own
//! multi-thread tokio runtime + a background swarm task) so callers — including
//! [`crate::RelayCoordinator`], which is plain synchronous posture data — never need to be async
//! themselves. This mirrors dmtap-p2p's containment shape exactly.
