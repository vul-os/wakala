# Metering & Billing

This chapter explains how the relay measures transfer, how account tiers and quotas gate
it, exactly what happens when you hit a cap, and how to check your usage against the
control plane. The headline first: **billing is opt-in**. A self-hosted relay with no
control-plane wiring runs *unbilled* — tokens are authorized by their name grants and
nothing is measured, gated, or phoned home. Everything below applies only when a relay
is linked to Vulos Cloud (`-cp-url` + `-cp-shared-secret`) **and** the agent's
credential is bound to an account.

---

## Who is billed, who is not

| Setup | Gated? | Metered? |
|---|---|---|
| Relay with no `-cp-url`/`-cp-shared-secret` (pure self-host) | no | no |
| Linked relay, static grant **without** `account_id` | no | no |
| Linked relay, static grant **with** `account_id` | yes | yes |
| Linked relay with `-cp-token-store` (agent token = CP install credential) | yes | yes |
| Traffic over a **verified direct endpoint** (client dials the box directly) | n/a | **no — never touches the relay** |

That last row is worth designing around: the direct fast path is not just lower
latency, it is *unmetered by the relay by construction*, because the bytes go
client↔box without transiting the relay at all. A box with a public IP that advertises
`-direct` only consumes relay quota when clients actually fall back to the tunnel.
(See [TUNNEL-GUIDE.md](TUNNEL-GUIDE.md#direct-first-relay-fallback).)

## What is measured

Per account, the relay accumulates two counters
([metering.go](../tunnel/server/metering.go), [proxy.go](../tunnel/server/proxy.go)):

- **Bytes** — request-body bytes as they stream *into* the tunnel, response-body bytes
  as they stream *out*, and for WebSocket sessions the spliced bytes in **both**
  directions. HTTP header bytes are not counted — the meters wrap body and splice
  streams, not the raw socket. All three paths meter **incrementally, per read chunk**
  ([`meterReader`](../tunnel/server/metering.go)) — a byte is counted the moment it
  crosses the relay, **not** when the request/stream finally closes. This matters for
  the long-lived traffic a relay specializes in (SSE, large downloads, hours-long
  WebSockets): a stream open across a flush is already partly billed, and one killed by
  a drain/redeploy/crash before it closes has its transferred bytes captured by the
  next (or final shutdown) flush rather than being lost. Counting is mutex-guarded and
  race-clean under the two concurrent WebSocket splice directions.
- **Sessions** — one per proxied public request (each yamux stream opened into the
  agent counts one).

> **Planned, not current:** the meter today counts proxied **body bytes** as described
> here. A shift to an **egress-based** billing model is a future direction, not a shipped
> behavior — bill against, and reason about, the counters documented on this page.

Unbilled sessions (`accountID == ""`) skip per-account metering entirely; the
direction-bucketed Prometheus metric is updated regardless (see
[Observing metering locally](#observing-metering-locally) below), so even a pure
self-host relay can watch its own volume.

### How measurements reach the control plane

Metering never blocks the data path — proxy code only bumps in-memory counters. A
background loop flushes **deltas** to the CP:

- **Cadence:** every 45 s by default (`Config.MeterFlushPeriod`), plus a final flush on
  graceful shutdown. This is one reason `vulos-relayd` drains on SIGTERM rather than
  dying: the last deltas survive deploys.
- **Wire:** `POST {cp}/api/relay/usage` with an envelope
  `{pop_id, region, report_id, items:[{account_id, bytes, sessions}]}`,
  HMAC-SHA256-signed over the exact body in `X-Pop-Sig` (keyed by `CP_SHARED_SECRET`).
- **Per-region attribution:** the envelope stamps this relay's `region` (from
  `-region`, e.g. `eu-central`, `af-south`) so the CP's billing meter can price relay
  GB **per-region** directly from the report — relay egress is not uniform-cost
  (Hetzner EU ~€1/TB vs Fly Africa $0.12/GB, ~6× EU), so the same account's GB may
  bill differently by which PoP carried it. One relay node serves one region, so the
  tag is per-report (envelope-level), mirroring `pop_id`. It is `omitempty`: a
  self-host / single-region relay sends no region and the CP applies its own
  default/flat rate (or its own `pop_id`→region map). The `region` tag is advisory
  metadata for pricing — the authoritative bytes are the per-account `items`.
- **Idempotency:** each batch carries a stable `report_id`
  (`<pop>-<boot-nonce>-<seq>`). A failed flush is retried later **with the same id**,
  so a batch the CP applied but whose response was lost dedups to a no-op instead of
  double-billing. The per-process boot nonce prevents id collisions across relay
  restarts, which would otherwise make the CP's dedup silently drop post-restart
  batches (under-billing).
- **Outage behavior:** failed batches queue for retry, bounded at 1024 batches
  (~12 h at the default cadence); beyond that the *oldest* are shed, favoring fresher
  usage. Traffic is never blocked by a CP outage — `addBytes`/`addSession` are cheap
  in-memory operations no matter what the network is doing.
- The per-relay `-pop-id` (default derived from the domain, e.g.
  `relay-relay-example-com`) namespaces report ids, so multiple relays report
  independently and the CP dedups per PoP.

## Tiers and quotas

Quotas are decided by the **control plane**, not the relay: the relay asks and
enforces, the CP answers from the same billing source as the rest of the suite
(`GET /api/relay/entitlement`, backed by the CP's quota table joined with
current-month usage). The relay allowance is a **monthly byte budget** plus a
concurrency cap, per tier. As defined in the CP's quota table at the time of writing
(`vulos-cloud` `internal/billing/quota_table.go` — the CP's live values govern; check
your entitlement rather than trusting docs):

| Tier | Relay transfer / month | Relay concurrency |
|---|---|---|
| Free | 5 GiB | 5 |
| Personal | 15 GiB | 10 |
| Pro | 25 GiB | 20 |
| Team | 30 GiB | 20 |
| Enterprise | 60 GiB | 100 |

Notes on how the CP applies these:

- A cap of 0 GiB means "no relay allowance" and is treated as exceeded as soon as any
  usage exists.
- **TURN** (meeting media relay) sessions are a separate dimension (`turn_cap`) with
  its own per-tier session budget; *either* dimension being exceeded flips the account
  over-quota.
- Usage is compared against the **current month**; the window rolls automatically.
- The CP's read posture is deliberately asymmetric: a *metering read error* fails open
  (a transient usage-DB problem never hard-denies a paying tenant); only the
  *over-quota* path denies.

---

## What happens at the cap

The enforcement point is the relay's **entitlement gate**
([gate.go](../tunnel/server/gate.go)), fed two ways:

1. a cached `GET /api/relay/entitlement` poll (30 s TTL by default, `Config.GateTTL`),
   and
2. — faster — the over-quota account list the CP returns in its response to each usage
   report, which is pushed straight into the gate (`markOverQuota`) so an over-cap
   account is cut on its **next request** rather than after a TTL lapse.

Concretely, when an account goes over quota:

1. **In-flight requests finish.** Nothing is severed mid-body.
2. **Subsequent public requests get `402 Payment Required`** with the body
   `relay quota exceeded or not permitted for this account`. The tunnel session itself
   stays registered — only requests are refused — so recovery is instant once the
   account is back in budget.
3. **New connects are refused** (`relay not permitted for this account` in the
   register ack): the connect gate requires `relay_allowed` and not-over-quota,
   fail-closed.
4. **Recovery is automatic**: when the CP stops reporting the account over quota (new
   monthly period, tier upgrade), the next entitlement refresh clears the verdict — no
   relay restart, no agent action needed beyond its normal operation.

Distinguish over-quota from two neighbors:

- **Revocation** — over-quota refuses *requests* but leaves the tunnel up; a
  definitive revoke (CP `revoked:true`/`404`, or the static revoked-list) *drops the
  live tunnel* via the revocation sweep and refuses reconnects. A revoke is sticky;
  over-quota clears on the next clean entitlement read.
- **Transient CP failure** — mid-session the gate fails *open*: a billing blip never
  cuts a live tunnel. Connect-time still fails closed, since an account that cannot be
  vetted cannot be admitted.

A worked timeline at the defaults, for intuition:

```
t+0s    account crosses its byte cap mid-download (the download completes)
t≤45s   next usage flush posts the deltas; CP's response lists the account over_quota
t+ε     relay pushes the verdict into the gate → next request answers 402
        (worst case without the push path: one gate TTL, ~30s, after the flush)
later   new month / upgrade → next entitlement refresh (≤30s) clears the 402
```

Watch it happen in operator telemetry: `vulos_relay_over_quota_cuts_total`,
`vulos_relay_requests_total{outcome="over_quota"}`, and
`vulos_relay_tunnel_cuts_total{reason="over_quota"}` on `/metrics`, plus info-level
`account marked over quota` and `request cut: over quota / entitlement denied` lines in
the structured log.

---

## Checking your usage

`GET {cp}/api/relay/entitlement` is the single read that answers "what's my tier, cap,
and consumption right now". Two credential forms are accepted (both fail-closed):

1. **Your install credential** (the one minted by the device-link flow — see
   [GETTING-STARTED.md](GETTING-STARTED.md#path-b--vulos-hosted-relay-account-linked)):

   ```bash
   curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $INSTALL_CREDENTIAL" \
        https://cloud.vulos.dev/api/relay/entitlement
   ```

   The CP also accepts the credential in an `X-Install-Credential` header.

2. **Service credential** — for relay operators only:
   `X-Relay-Auth: $CP_SHARED_SECRET` plus an explicit `?account_id=` (or
   `X-Account-ID` header). This is how the relay itself reads entitlements on behalf
   of connected agents. A presented-but-invalid install credential never falls through
   to the service path.

Response shape:

```json
{
  "account_id":    "acct-42",
  "tier":          "pro",
  "relay_allowed": true,
  "over_quota":    false,
  "byte_cap":      26843545600,
  "turn_cap":      100,
  "used_bytes":    1073741824,
  "used_sessions": 12
}
```

- `byte_cap` / `used_bytes` — the monthly relay byte budget and current-month
  consumption, in bytes.
- `turn_cap` / `used_sessions` — the TURN session budget and consumption.
- `over_quota` — true when *either* dimension is exceeded; this is the same signal
  that produces `402` at the relay.
- `relay_allowed` — whether the tier grants relay at all (and is not over-quota).
- The response may also carry `revoked: true`, which is a definitive kill for the
  credential (see
  [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md#token-lifecycle-ttl-rotation-revocation)).

There is deliberately **no usage-read endpoint on the relay itself** — the relay holds
only unflushed deltas (seconds of data); the CP is the ledger of record.

### Observing metering locally

Independent of billing, the relay's admin listener exposes the raw volume it proxies:

```bash
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:9090/metrics | grep proxied_bytes
# vulos_relay_proxied_bytes_total{direction="inbound"}  …   request bodies in
# vulos_relay_proxied_bytes_total{direction="outbound"} …   response bodies out
# vulos_relay_proxied_bytes_total{direction="duplex"}   …   spliced WS bytes
```

These counters are always maintained, billed or not, and are the fastest way to
sanity-check "how much is actually transiting this relay" against what the CP ledger
says. They are relay-wide, not per-account — per-account attribution exists only on
the billed path, and only account **ids** (never names/PII) leave the relay in usage
reports.

### Expected accounting slack

The honest error bars, all bounded and all in your favor or neutral:

- Up to one flush interval (45 s) of usage is always in flight; a hard-killed relay
  (not SIGTERM-drained) loses at most that window. Because egress is metered per-chunk
  (not at connection close), this bound holds even for a stream that has been open for
  hours — only the bytes since the last flush are ever at risk, not the whole stream.
- Under a prolonged CP outage (>~12 h at defaults) the oldest queued batches are shed
  — under-billing, never over-billing.
- Over-quota detection lags consumption by up to one flush + one gate refresh, so an
  account can overshoot its cap by roughly what it can transfer in that window; the
  push-on-usage-report path keeps this to seconds in practice.
- Header bytes and traffic on the direct path are not counted at all.
- The in-memory pending map is bounded (50,000 accounts); past that, *new* accounts'
  metering is dropped until a flush clears space — traffic itself is never blocked.

## Scaling & cost evidence (grounded, not hand-waved)

The relay is the **only bandwidth-bound service** in the suite, so "does it scale
gracefully *and* stay cost-managed" is a single question with a measured answer, not a
marketing line. The numbers below come from race-checked, in-process tests on the real
ws+yamux path (no mocks) — reproduce them yourself; nothing here is asserted only in
prose.

### Cost per TB — the €1/TB Hetzner data plane

Marginal cost is a direct function of bytes moved. The projection lives in a tiny,
unit-tested package ([`tunnel/cost`](../tunnel/cost/cost.go)) so the arithmetic is code,
not a claim:

```go
cost.ProjectEUR(bytes, cost.HetznerEUEURPerTB)  // euros for `bytes` at ~€1 / decimal TB
cost.TBFor(5.0, cost.HetznerEUEURPerTB)          // 5.0 TB — what a €5/mo bandwidth line covers
```

A "TB" here is the **decimal** TB (1e12 bytes) bandwidth is actually billed in — not the
binary TiB — because mixing the two silently misprices by ~10%. Worked figures
(`cost_test.go`, `TestProjectEUR_KnownVolumes`): 1 TB ⇒ €1.00, 500 GB ⇒ €0.50, 1 GB ⇒
€0.001, and cost is exactly **linear** in volume. Fly Africa egress (~$0.12/GB ≈
€110/TB, ~100× Hetzner) is the reference rate behind *not* running general traffic
there — it is a gap-region fallback, and the per-region `region` tag on each usage report
is what lets the CP price those bytes differently.

The metering→cost path is proven end-to-end: `TestConcurrentTunnels_ExactBytesAndCost_NoLeak`
([`tunnel/concurrency_cost_test.go`](../tunnel/concurrency_cost_test.go)) drives a
concurrent fan-out across 16 real tunnels and asserts the relay's cumulative byte counter
equals the moved volume **exactly** (GETs carry no request body and headers are
unmetered), then projects the euro cost off that exact figure. So the number the CP bills
on and the number this page prices on are the same number.

### Concurrency ceiling — tunnels per node

`TestTunnelScalingCost` (the `scaling_bench_test.go` harness, run it with
`go test ./tunnel/ -run TestTunnelScalingCost -v`) opens many real tunnels against one
relay and measures steady-state cost. Representative loopback run (**both** tunnel ends
live in the process, so the per-tunnel figure covers agent **and** server; the
server-only fraction is roughly half):

| Metric | Measured |
|---|---|
| Per-tunnel heap (both ends) | ~66 KiB |
| Aggregate forwarding throughput | ~18 MiB/s, ~280 req/s (32 workers, 64 KiB payloads) |
| Idle-tunnel ceiling, Fly `shared-cpu-1x-256MB` | ~2,400 tunnels |
| Idle-tunnel ceiling, Fly `shared-cpu-1x-512MB` | ~6,400 tunnels |
| Idle-tunnel ceiling, Fly `shared-cpu-1x-1GB` | ~14,000 tunnels |

These are **idle-registration** ceilings (a reserve is held back for the Go runtime +
working set); concurrent *active* streams are separately capped per agent
(`MaxStreamsPerAgent`) and per node (`SoftCapacity`), and the autoscaler provisions a new
node before a node saturates (see [saturation signal](#how-measurements-reach-the-control-plane)
and `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`). The harness fails loudly if per-tunnel heap regresses past a
sanity bound, so a leak or bloat can't silently erode the ceiling.

### Graceful under load — no leaks, no starvation, clean drain

Three race-checked guarantees back "scales *gracefully*"
([`tunnel/concurrency_cost_test.go`](../tunnel/concurrency_cost_test.go)):

- **No goroutine leak.** After N concurrent tunnels register, relay traffic, and tear
  down, the process returns to its goroutine baseline (Δ ≤ 15). A per-tunnel or
  per-request leak would blow the ceiling above — this pins it flat.
- **Backpressure, not buffering.** Slow consumers that stop draining their response do
  **not** starve other tunnels, and memory stays bounded — yamux per-stream flow control
  holds in-flight bytes to ~a receive window, so K parked 8 MiB readers cost ~K×window,
  not K×8 MiB (measured ~4.5 MiB held vs. 33 MiB if buffered in full). This is the
  positive-capacity counterpart to the [slow-body DoS guard](SECURITY.md) that cuts the
  malicious-upload case.
- **Graceful drain under load.** With N in-flight streams flowing, a `Shutdown` (the
  SIGTERM path) **blocks** until every stream completes with its full, un-mixed body —
  no dropped in-flight bytes — while **new** connections are refused the moment the drain
  starts. Combined with the final metering flush on shutdown, this is why a deploy or
  scale-down neither drops a live download nor loses its last window of billable bytes.

## Operator configuration recap

All billing wiring on `vulos-relayd` (see [TUNNEL.md](TUNNEL.md#flags--env) for the
full flag table):

| Flag | Env | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `-cp-url` | `VULOS_CP_URL` | Vulos Cloud base URL for entitlement + usage |
| `-cp-shared-secret` | `CP_SHARED_SECRET` | HMAC key for `X-Pop-Sig` + service auth for entitlement reads |
| `-pop-id` | `VULOS_RELAY_POP_ID` | This relay's PoP id (report-id namespace; default derived from the domain) |
| `-region` | `VULOS_RELAY_REGION` | This relay's geo tag, stamped on usage reports for per-region GB pricing (e.g. `eu-central`, `af-south`); also drives nearest-node routing |
| `-cp-token-store` | `VULOS_RELAY_CP_TOKENS=1` | Agent tokens are CP install credentials (requires both of the above) |

Both `-cp-url` and `-cp-shared-secret` are required to enable billing; with either
missing the relay logs `running UNBILLED (no -cp-url/-cp-shared-secret)` and serves
grants without gating or metering. `-cp-token-store` without them is a startup error.
Mixed mode works too: a static grants file where only some grants carry `account_id`
bills exactly those and serves the rest unbilled.

Library embedders reach the same knobs via `server.Config.CP` (a `*CPClient` with
`BaseURL`, `SharedSecret`, `PoPID`, and `Region` for per-region pricing),
`Config.GateTTL` (entitlement cache, default 30 s), and `Config.MeterFlushPeriod`
(default 45 s). `vulos-relayd` wires `CPClient.Region` from `-region` automatically.
