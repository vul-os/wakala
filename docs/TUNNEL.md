# Vulos Sovereign Reverse Tunnel

A self-hosted reverse tunnel that lets a loopback-bound Vulos box publish itself on
the public internet **without opening any inbound ports, without a static IP, and
without any third-party relay** (it replaces external `frp`).

The box runs an **agent** that dials a **single outbound `wss://` connection** to a
Vulos **relay server** you control. The relay serves a public URL and reverse-
proxies inbound requests back down that one connection to the box's local port.

```
   public client                    relay server (public)                box (loopback only)
        │  https://box1.relay.example.com     │                                 │
        ├────────────────────────────────────►│                                 │
        │                                      │  yamux stream (1 per request)   │
        │                                      ├────────────────────────────────►│  agent
        │                                      │   over ONE outbound wss control │   │ dials localhost:8080
        │                                      │   connection the AGENT opened   │   ▼
        │◄─────────── response ────────────────┤◄────────────────────────────────┤  local app
```

Only **outbound 443** is required from the box. The box binds nothing inbound.

---

## Transport & design

- **One outbound connection.** The agent opens a single `wss://` WebSocket to the
  relay's control endpoint (`/_vulos-relay/control`). WebSocket is edge/CDN/TLS-
  termination friendly and only needs outbound 443.
- **Multiplexing with yamux.** After a JSON handshake, both sides hand that
  WebSocket's `net.Conn` to [`hashicorp/yamux`](https://github.com/hashicorp/yamux).
  The **relay is the yamux client** (opens one stream per inbound public request);
  the **agent is the yamux server** (accepts streams, proxies each to its one local
  target). Each stream carries a plain HTTP/1.1 request/response — no extra framing —
  which is also what makes **WebSocket-upgrade passthrough** transparent.
- **Routing.**
  - **Subdomain mode (primary):** `https://<name>.<relay-domain>` — needs a wildcard
    DNS record `*.relay.example.com`.
  - **Path mode (fallback):** `https://<relay-domain>/t/<name>/…` — enable with
    `-path-mode` when you can't provision wildcard DNS.
- **Reconnect.** The agent maintains the tunnel with exponential backoff + full
  jitter and reconnects automatically after any drop.
- **Graceful drain.** On `SIGTERM`/`SIGINT` (what Fly and most orchestrators send on
  deploy/restart) the relay flips `/readyz` to draining, stops accepting new
  connections, lets in-flight requests finish (bounded), then flushes the final
  metered usage before exiting — so a rolling restart neither drops a live request
  mid-flight nor loses the last usage deltas. Agents reconnect to the replacement.

## Direct-IP fast path (optional, ICE-like)

A box with a public/static IP or hostname can serve the OS on its **own** public TLS
listener and let clients dial it **directly** — near-native latency, full bandwidth,
traffic that never touches (or is metered by) the relay — while still keeping the
relay tunnel as the always-works fallback for NAT'd/CGNAT boxes. It is off unless a
box opts in, and it is **never trusted on the box's word**:

- **Advertise.** The agent may set `DirectEndpoint` (a bare `https://host[:port]`
  origin); it is sent in the register frame alongside the relay tunnel. Empty means
  "relay only" (the default, always-works path).
- **Verify (reachability + ownership).** Before surfacing it to any client, the relay
  probes `{endpoint}/_vulos-direct/probe` over the public internet with a fresh
  256-bit nonce in `X-Vulos-Direct-Probe` and requires the box to **echo the nonce**.
  Only a box that actually serves that TLS endpoint sees the nonce, so echoing it
  proves control (a box cannot advertise a victim's IP/hostname to hijack its
  traffic). The probe is **SSRF-guarded** exactly like the agent's loopback guard:
  the host is screened before dial, the *resolved* IP is re-screened at connect
  (anti-DNS-rebind), only public IPs are allowed, and redirects are refused.
  Verification runs **only after** auth + entitlement pass — an unauthorized box can
  never make the relay probe an arbitrary target. A failure is **non-fatal**: the
  tunnel still comes up on the relay path.
- **Discover + fall back.** A client asks the relay
  `GET /_vulos-direct/resolve` (host-routed to the tunnel name, same as any public
  request); the relay returns the box's **verified** direct endpoint or `direct=false`.
  The client (see `tunnel/direct`) attempts the direct URL first and transparently
  falls back to the relay URL on any failure — same app, same auth, just a faster
  transport. Disable relay-wide with `Config.DisableDirect` (advertised endpoints are
  then ignored and every box is served purely over the relay tunnel).

## SFU-host registry (optional, off by default)

The same **direct-first / verify-then-serve** doctrine that powers the fast path
above is reused, verbatim, to place a **big-call SFU media node** for a video app.
A self-hoster who wants big calls on their **own** infra installs an SFU worker next
to their box (an in-process Pion SFU, or a co-located LiveKit server) and registers it
here; when a call escalates past the mesh cap, the box resolves a reachable SFU
endpoint and hands it back to the client as the join `serverUrl`. This mirrors the
GPU streaming-host pattern (STREAM-BYO-01) and **reuses the same
`verifyDirectEndpoint` verifier** — the nonce-echo, SSRF-guarded, DNS-rebind-defended
ownership proof from the fast path — because it proves endpoint ownership, not "is a
streamer", so it applies to an SFU endpoint unchanged (`tunnel/server/sfuhost.go`).

```
POST {relay}/api/meet/host/register     → 200 {host}   (VERIFIES the endpoint first)
POST {relay}/api/meet/host/heartbeat    → 200          (refreshes a 90s TTL)
POST {relay}/api/meet/host/deregister   → 200
GET  {relay}/api/meet/host/resolve?name=<name> → 200 {allocation | available:false}
```

- **Off by default.** The whole registry is gated behind `-sfu-host-registry`
  (`VULOS_RELAY_SFU_HOST_REGISTRY=1`); with it off, register/heartbeat/deregister
  return `404` and `resolve` is naturally empty. Even enabled it is **inert until a
  box registers** — `resolve` returns `available:false` and the caller keeps whatever
  static `serverUrl` it already had (unchanged Phase-1 behavior).
- **Auth mirrors the tunnel.** register/heartbeat/deregister require the **same**
  bearer token + name grant a box uses for its tunnel, and pass the same account
  entitlement gate (fail-closed for billed accounts; an unbilled `""` token is always
  allowed — self-host). Verification runs **only after** auth, so an unauthorized box
  can never make the relay probe an arbitrary target.
- **`resolve` is SCOPED BY name.** The relay is shared across accounts, so `resolve`
  requires a `?name=` (the box's own token-authorized tunnel name) and only ever
  returns a host that name itself registered. An unscoped "first live host" would hand
  box B's clients box A's SFU endpoint — a cross-tenant routing leak — so an
  empty/unmatched name is `available:false` (fail-closed). The lookup carries no user
  data and mutates nothing, so it is unauthenticated; the SFU's own `VULOS-MEET/1`
  token gate is still the security boundary that admits each joiner.

## Security model (fails closed — this is internet-facing)

- **Agent auth:** a per-agent **bearer token** (`Authorization: Bearer …`, also
  echoed in the register frame; they must agree). Validated with **constant-time**
  comparison. Unauthenticated control connections are rejected before/after upgrade.
- **Name binding:** a token may serve **only the name(s) it is granted**. Names
  cannot be hijacked — a live name is held by exactly one session (first-come);
  a second claimant is rejected, not swapped in.
- **SSRF guard:** the agent forwards **only** to its one configured `localhost:PORT`
  target — never to a host named by the relay or the request. Non-loopback targets
  (private IPs, `169.254.169.254`, arbitrary hosts, `0.0.0.0`) are refused at
  startup and re-checked per stream.
- **Bounds:** max concurrent agents, max concurrent streams/agent, request header
  size cap, request body size cap, control-message size cap, idle timeout, and
  keepalive-based dead-peer detection. The keepalive is **adaptive and idle-aware**
  (`tunnel/internal/keepalive`): it pings at the base interval (relay 10s / agent 20s)
  while a tunnel is active and backs off to a 60s idle interval after 2min of no
  streams, restoring on activity — cutting idle cost without ever evicting the session.
  Memory is bounded.
- **Rate limiting (429):** three memory-bounded token-bucket limiters sit on top of
  the hard caps above — control-connection attempts **per source IP** (throttles
  auth/CP churn *before* spending a WS upgrade; keyed on the real client IP — the
  observed peer when directly exposed, the left-most `X-Forwarded-For` entry behind a
  trusted edge, so one edge IP can't collapse a fleet into one bucket), public requests
  **per tunnel**, and
  an **aggregate global** cap across all tunnels. Each returns `429` (with
  `Retry-After`). Buckets are lazily created, idle-evicted, and key-capped so a flood
  of distinct keys cannot grow memory. All are configurable with safe defaults; a
  negative rate disables a limiter (trusted-edge / self-host).
- **Over-quota cut (402):** an account past its billing cap is cut with `402` on its
  next request (the CP's over-quota verdict from the usage report is fed straight into
  the entitlement gate instead of waiting for the gate TTL to lapse).
- **Token / credential revocation:** a leaked or retired credential is revoked without
  hand-editing the grants file. A file/env static revoked-list
  (`{"tokens":[],"names":[],"accounts":[]}`) and a runtime `RevokeToken` /
  `RevokeName` / `RevokeAccount` API are consulted **at connect** (refused) and by a
  periodic **live-session revocation sweep** that drops any matching tunnel promptly.
  For CP-linked installs, an entitlement `revoked:true` or a `404` for a
  previously-valid credential is a definitive revoke (reuses the existing entitlement
  poll — no new CP round trip). Connect stays fail-closed; mid-session stays fail-open
  on a transient CP blip but cuts on a definitive revoke.
- **Header hygiene / no client IP spoofing:** hop-by-hop headers are stripped both
  ways. The relay is the **ingress trust boundary**, so by default (directly
  internet-facing) it **overwrites** `X-Forwarded-For` / `X-Real-IP` /
  `X-Forwarded-Proto` with the **observed peer** — a public client cannot forge the
  source IP the box's app reads for allowlists/rate-limits/audit/geo.
  `-trust-proxy-headers` (env `VULOS_RELAY_TRUST_PROXY_HEADERS=1`) flips this to
  **trust a fronting proxy**: the incoming `X-Forwarded-For` is preserved and the
  peer (the edge) is appended, and the edge's `X-Forwarded-Proto` is honored. Enable
  it **only** when a trusted TLS-terminating edge/CDN actually fronts the relay (the
  Fly deployment — `fly.toml` sets it); enabling it while directly exposed re-opens
  the spoof. Internal errors are never leaked to clients (generic `502`/`403`/etc.).
- **Direct-endpoint SSRF guard (relay side):** before the relay surfaces a
  box-advertised direct/SFU endpoint it **probes** it, and the probe is
  screened both at parse time and at connect time (resolved-IP re-screen defeats
  DNS-rebind), refusing loopback/private/link-local/CGNAT/metadata/documentation
  targets. The screen also unwraps **IPv6 transition addresses** (NAT64
  `64:ff9b::/96`, 6to4 `2002::/16`, Teredo `2001::/32`) and re-screens the embedded
  IPv4, so an address like `64:ff9b::7f00:1` (which carries `127.0.0.1`) cannot be
  used to reach an internal service through a NAT64/6to4 gateway.
- **TLS everywhere:** run the relay behind an edge/CDN that terminates TLS, or give
  it `-cert`/`-key` to terminate itself. On the self-terminating path the relay pins an
  explicit hardened floor — **TLS 1.2 minimum + ALPN (`h2`, `http/1.1`)** — rather than
  inheriting Go-version-dependent stdlib defaults, and preserves an operator-supplied
  `TLSConfig` verbatim (e.g. a stricter TLS 1.3 floor).

## Honest limitations

- **HTTP(S)/WS only.** This tunnels HTTP and WebSocket. It is not a raw TCP/UDP
  tunnel (no SSH/arbitrary-TCP mode like `frp`'s TCP proxy). That covers Vulos web
  surfaces; non-HTTP protocols are out of scope for now.
- **Token stores.** Two are built in: a JSON grants file / env var (`server.NewStaticTokenStore`,
  with a static + runtime revoked-list), and a CP-backed store (`-cp-token-store`)
  that resolves each agent's install credential to its Vulos account against the
  control plane. `server.TokenStore` is still the seam for a signed-token or fully
  DB-backed store — those aren't implemented yet.
- **No multi-relay HA / sticky sessions.** A name is served by whichever single
  relay instance the agent connected to. Horizontal scaling of the relay tier needs
  a shared session directory (future work); today, run one relay per region/cell.
- **Dead-peer detection latency.** A hard-killed agent's name frees on the next
  keepalive miss — ~10s while the tunnel was active (base ping), up to ~70s (idle
  interval + write timeout) if it had already gone idle under the adaptive keepalive.
  A clean `Stop()` frees it at once. Note this is *slowed heartbeat*, not eviction:
  **true idle-session eviction** — closing an idle tunnel outright — is **planned, not
  implemented**.
- **Hosted-relay plaintext for NAT'd boxes.** A NAT'd box with no direct path is
  reached over a relay that terminates TLS, so a *hosted* relay sees that leg's
  plaintext (cookies/tokens included). This is the ratified posture, not a bug — use a
  verified direct endpoint or a self-run relay for relay-blindness. **SNI / TLS
  passthrough** (which would make a NAT'd box↔user leg opaque to a hosted relay) is
  **planned, not implemented**. See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md#planned-hardening).
- **Egress-metering billing model.** The meter counts proxied bytes as documented in
  [METERING-BILLING.md](METERING-BILLING.md); a move to an egress-based billing model
  is a future direction, **not** current behavior.
- **No per-request auth on the public side.** The relay exposes whatever the local
  app exposes; auth is the app's job (same as `frp`). The relay only authenticates
  *agents*, not *public visitors* (it does rate-limit them — see the security model).
- **Revocation latency is bounded, not instant.** A mid-session revoke cuts on the
  next sweep tick (`-revoke-sweep`, default 20s), plus — for the CP path — up to one
  gate TTL for the entitlement poll to observe it. A runtime `Revoke*` call sweeps
  immediately.

## Running the relay server (`vulos-relayd`)

```
go build -o vulos-relayd ./cmd/vulos-relayd

# Behind a TLS-terminating edge/CDN (recommended), plain HTTP on a private port:
VULOS_RELAY_TOKENS='[{"token":"SECRET1","names":["box1"]}]' \
  ./vulos-relayd -addr :8443 -domain relay.example.com

# Or terminate TLS itself:
./vulos-relayd -addr :443 -domain relay.example.com \
  -cert /etc/tls/fullchain.pem -key /etc/tls/privkey.pem \
  -tokens-file /etc/vulos/relay-tokens.json

# No wildcard DNS? Use path mode:
./vulos-relayd -domain relay.example.com -path-mode -tokens-file grants.json
```

### Flags / env

**Core**

| Flag | Env | Default | Purpose |
|------|-----|---------|---------|
| `-addr` | `VULOS_RELAY_ADDR` | `:8443` | Public tunnel listen address. |
| `-domain` | `VULOS_RELAY_DOMAIN` | — (required) | Base relay domain. |
| `-tokens-file` | `VULOS_RELAY_TOKENS` (inline JSON) | — (required unless `-cp-token-store`) | Agent grants. |
| `-path-mode` | `VULOS_RELAY_PATH_MODE=1` | `false` | Also serve `/t/<name>/` fallback. |
| `-trust-proxy-headers` | `VULOS_RELAY_TRUST_PROXY_HEADERS=1` | `false` | Trust `X-Forwarded-*` from a fronting proxy. **Off** (default, directly internet-facing) overwrites them with the observed peer so a client cannot spoof its source IP. Enable **only** behind a trusted TLS-terminating edge/CDN (the Fly deployment sets it). |
| `-cert` / `-key` | | — | Terminate TLS here (omit if behind an edge). |
| `-max-agents` | | `256` | Max concurrent agents. |
| `-max-request-bytes` | `VULOS_RELAY_MAX_REQUEST_BYTES` | `0` (⇒ 256 MiB) | Max public-request body in bytes; overflow returns `413`. `0` uses the 256 MiB default (covers the vast majority of single-file uploads); a negative value is refused. |
| `-sfu-host-registry` | `VULOS_RELAY_SFU_HOST_REGISTRY=1` | `false` | Enable the SFU-host registry (`/api/meet/host/*`). Off ⇒ those routes `404`. |

**Admin / metrics (WAVE50-RELAY-OBSERVABILITY)** — a SEPARATE listener from the
public tunnel, serving `/metrics`, `/healthz`, `/readyz`.

| Flag | Env | Default | Purpose |
|------|-----|---------|---------|
| `-admin-addr` | `VULOS_RELAY_ADMIN_ADDR` | `127.0.0.1:9090` | Admin/metrics listen address. Empty disables it. Loopback-only unless a metrics token is set. |
| `-metrics-token` | `VULOS_RELAY_METRICS_TOKEN` | — | Bearer token required for **non-loopback** `/metrics` access. Binding `-admin-addr` to a routable address **requires** this (refuses to start otherwise). |
| | `VULOS_RELAY_LOG_LEVEL` | `info` | Structured-log level (`debug`\|`info`\|`warn`\|`error`). |
| | `VULOS_RELAY_LOG_FORMAT` | JSON | Set `text` for text-format logs. |

**Rate limiting (WAVE34-RELAY-HARDEN)** — `0` uses the built-in default; a **negative**
value DISABLES that limiter.

| Flag | Env | Default | Purpose |
|------|-----|---------|---------|
| `-ratelimit-control-rate` / `-ratelimit-control-burst` | `VULOS_RELAY_CTRL_RATE` / `_BURST` | `5`/s, burst `20` | Control-conn attempts per source IP. |
| `-ratelimit-req-rate` / `-ratelimit-req-burst` | `VULOS_RELAY_REQ_RATE` / `_BURST` | `50`/s, burst `100` | Public requests per tunnel. |
| `-ratelimit-global-rate` / `-ratelimit-global-burst` | `VULOS_RELAY_GLOBAL_RATE` / `_BURST` | `500`/s, burst `1000` | Aggregate public requests across all tunnels. |

**Revocation (WAVE41-RELAY-REVOCATION)**

| Flag | Env | Default | Purpose |
|------|-----|---------|---------|
| `-revoked-file` | `VULOS_RELAY_REVOKED` (inline JSON) | — | Static revoked-list `{"tokens":[],"names":[],"accounts":[]}`. |
| `-revoke-sweep` | `VULOS_RELAY_REVOKE_SWEEP` | `20s` | Live-session recheck cadence. `<0` disables the sweep (connect-time revocation still applies). |

**Account-linking + billing (WAVE24-RELAY-BILLING, optional)** — omit all to run
UNBILLED (pure self-host).

| Flag | Env | Default | Purpose |
|------|-----|---------|---------|
| `-cp-url` | `VULOS_CP_URL` | — | Vulos Cloud base URL for entitlement/usage. |
| `-cp-shared-secret` | `CP_SHARED_SECRET` | — | Shared secret for the usage HMAC + entitlement service auth. |
| `-pop-id` | `VULOS_RELAY_POP_ID` | derived from domain | This relay's PoP id (usage dedup per-PoP). |
| `-cp-token-store` | `VULOS_RELAY_CP_TOKENS=1` | `false` | Resolve agent tokens as CP install credentials instead of a static grants file (requires `-cp-url` + `-cp-shared-secret`). |

**Geo-distributed pool + autoscale (optional)** — make the node self-aware and
publish a saturation signal for pool scaling. All optional; leaving the soft caps
at `0` keeps single-node behavior (no sampler runs).

| Flag | Env | Default | Purpose |
|------|-----|---------|---------|
| `-node-id` | `VULOS_RELAY_NODE_ID` | — | Stable pool id for this node (e.g. `hel1-a`); surfaced on `/healthz`. |
| `-region` | `VULOS_RELAY_REGION` | — | Coarse geo tag (e.g. `eu-central`, `af-south`) a router uses to steer a client to the nearest node. |
| `-provider` | `VULOS_RELAY_PROVIDER` | — | Informational host tag (e.g. `hetzner`, `vultr`). |
| `-soft-max-agents` | `VULOS_RELAY_SOFT_MAX_AGENTS` | `0` (ignore) | Soft agent cap — one saturation dimension. |
| `-soft-max-streams` | `VULOS_RELAY_SOFT_MAX_STREAMS` | `0` (ignore) | Soft in-flight-stream cap. |
| `-soft-max-bytes-per-sec` | `VULOS_RELAY_SOFT_MAX_BPS` | `0` (ignore) | Soft throughput cap (bytes/sec). |
| `-saturation-sample-period` | `VULOS_RELAY_SAT_PERIOD` | `0` (⇒ 15s) | How often to recompute the saturation gauge. `<0` disables the sampler. |

These are **soft** (scaling) limits, distinct from the hard `-max-agents` / rate
caps that bound abuse. When any soft cap is set, the node publishes
`vulos_relay_saturation_ratio` on `/metrics`. See the pool/autoscale section below.

**Grants JSON:** each grant is a token, the names it may serve, and an optional
`account_id` (link the token to a Vulos account for gating + metering; omit it to
serve the token unbilled).
```json
[
  {"token": "SECRET1", "names": ["box1"]},
  {"token": "SECRET2", "names": ["alice", "alice-staging"], "account_id": "acct-42"}
]
```

### DNS it needs

- **Subdomain mode (primary):** a wildcard `A`/`AAAA` (or `CNAME`) record
  `*.relay.example.com → <relay host>`, plus `relay.example.com` itself. TLS needs a
  wildcard cert (`*.relay.example.com`) — trivial with an ACME edge/CDN.
- **Path mode (fallback):** just `relay.example.com → <relay host>`; no wildcard.

### Observability

The relay serves metrics + health on a **separate admin listener** (`-admin-addr`,
default `127.0.0.1:9090`), never on the public tunnel port:

- `GET /metrics` — Prometheus text-exposition metrics (`vulos_relay_*`): active
  agents/streams, agent connects/disconnects, requests by outcome, auth failures by
  reason, `429`s by surface, tunnel cuts by reason, proxied bytes by direction, and
  **`vulos_relay_saturation_ratio`** (this node's load vs its soft capacity — the
  autoscale signal). Every label is a fixed enum, so cardinality is bounded and no
  attacker-controlled value (host/path/name/account/IP/token) ever becomes a series.
  Loopback-only unless `-metrics-token` is set (required for a non-loopback bind).
- `GET /healthz` — `ok agents=<n>` liveness ping for load balancers (also echoes
  `node=<id> region=<r>` when `-node-id`/`-region` are set, so a pool health checker
  can tell which node answered).
- `GET /readyz` — `ready` (200) once the background loops are up; `503` while draining.

Structured `slog` logs (JSON by default) cover the security-relevant lifecycle
events with a bounded field set (`name`, `account`, `remote`, `reason`) and never
emit a token or secret.

## Geo-distributed pool & autoscale-on-saturation

The relay is the suite's **core reachability product**, so it is built to run as a
**geo-distributed pool of N nodes** — Hetzner as the primary region, Vultr for a JHB
edge / HA — on **flat-bandwidth hosts**. Those hosts have **no managed autoscaler**,
so capacity control is **app-level**. It has three provider-agnostic pieces, in the
`tunnel/autoscale` package (a library the deploy-side orchestrator wires):

1. **Saturation detection.** Each node samples its own load — live agents, in-flight
   streams, and derived throughput (bytes/sec) — and normalizes it to a `0..1+`
   **saturation ratio** against its soft capacity (the `-soft-max-*` flags). A
   `Detector` applies **hysteresis**: it only signals **scale-up** when the ratio
   stays above a high-watermark for a sustained window, and **scale-down** when it
   stays below a low-watermark (with more than the floor of nodes), separated by a
   cooldown — so a brief spike never thrashes the pool. The current ratio is published
   as **`vulos_relay_saturation_ratio`** on `/metrics`.

2. **The `Provisioner` seam.** A tiny two-method interface —
   `Provision(ctx) (Node, error)` and `Decommission(ctx, id) error` — that an
   **orchestrator implements** to actually boot / tear down a relay node on whatever
   host it uses (a Hetzner Cloud API call, a Vultr instance, a Terraform run, a Fly
   machine, …). **The relay never hardcodes a cloud provider**; it only calls these.
   Wiring a real provider behind this interface is the deploy-side integration.

3. **Health-checked pool membership.** A `Pool` tracks the live nodes with a
   background **health checker** (polls each node's `/readyz`) and a
   **nearest-healthy** selector (region-preference, least-loaded tiebreak), so a
   router / geo-DNS layer can steer a client to the closest live node and a **drained
   node stops receiving new traffic** before it is torn down. The node running the
   autoscaler is never chosen as a decommission target.

The in-process `autoscale.Autoscaler` ties them together (read a `LoadSource` each
interval → `Detector` → `Provisioner` + `Pool`); `*server.Server` implements
`autoscale.LoadSource` directly, so it can be handed straight to an autoscaler. An
operator who prefers to scale from **outside** the process can instead just scrape
`vulos_relay_saturation_ratio` and drive their own control loop — the metric is the
same signal, and the `Provisioner` is left unset.

**No single-node assumption.** A node is self-aware (`-node-id` / `-region`) and a
public request for a tunnel name it does **not** hold fails **clean** — `502` for a
well-formed name with no local session (e.g. a misroute for a name that lives on
another node), `404` for a host outside the relay domain. Which node actually holds a
given box's tunnel is **deploy-side affinity**: a box dials one home node, and per-name
routing to that node is done by DNS / a directory, not by this process.

**What's deploy-only.** Real **geo-DNS / anycast** client steering, and a **real
`Provisioner`** that talks to Hetzner/Vultr, are deployment concerns — this repo ships
the **seams + logic + tests**, not a live multi-node fabric. Per-GB-per-region metering
rides the existing account-linking usage path (`POST /api/relay/usage`), tagged by the
node's `-pop-id` (set it per node/region so usage dedups and attributes per PoP).

# Optionally advertise a Direct-IP fast path (a box with a public IP). The relay
# verifies reachability + ownership before advertising it; falls back to the relay
# tunnel if verification fails. Also VULOS_RELAY_DIRECT_ENDPOINT.
vulos-relay-agent -server wss://relay.example.com -token SECRET1 -name box1 \
  -local 127.0.0.1:8080 -direct https://box1.example.com
```

`-local` must be a loopback address. The agent binds nothing inbound. `-direct` (if
set) must be a bare `https://` origin the box serves publicly.

## Account-linking + usage metering (optional)

A self-host relay runs **UNBILLED** by default: tokens are authorized (name grants)
but no account gating or metering happens — no Vulos account required.

Linking is opt-in. Run `vulos-relayd` with `-cp-url` + `-cp-shared-secret` (+
`-pop-id`) to connect it to Vulos Cloud, after which the relay:

- **Gates** each account-bound token against its relay entitlement
  (`GET /api/relay/entitlement`) — fails **closed** at connect (a denied or
  un-vettable account is refused) and **open** mid-session (a transient CP blip never
  cuts a live tunnel; a definitive deny/revoke does).
- **Meters** per-account byte + session deltas and flushes them to
  `POST /api/relay/usage`, HMAC-signed (`X-Pop-Sig`) with a monotonic, idempotent
  `report_id`. The flush runs off the data path with retry/restore.

A grant's `account_id` (in the grants JSON) is what links a token to an account. A
grant with no `account_id` is served but never metered. Alternatively,
`-cp-token-store` resolves each agent's install credential to its account directly
against the CP.

## Embedding the agent (library API)

The `agent` package mirrors wede's `internal/tunnel.Manager` so wede can swap its
frp subprocess for this in-process client. Status vocabulary is identical:
`stopped` / `starting` / `connected` / `error`.

```go
import "github.com/vul-os/vulos-relay/tunnel/agent"

a := agent.New(agent.Options{
    ServerURL: "wss://relay.example.com", // http/https normalized to ws/wss
    Token:     "SECRET1",
    Name:      "box1",
    LocalAddr: "127.0.0.1:8080",          // must be loopback (SSRF guard)
})

// Start returns immediately; it dials + registers + maintains async with backoff.
if err := a.Start(ctx); err != nil { /* bad options */ }

url  := a.PublicURL()   // "https://box1.relay.example.com" when connected, else ""
snap := a.Snapshot()    // { Status, PublicURL, Connected, LastError, Log }

a.Stop()                // tears down; frees the name immediately
```

`Snapshot()` never includes the token. `Options` also has `TLSConfig` (pin a CA for
a self-hosted relay) and `InsecureSkipVerify` (testing only).
