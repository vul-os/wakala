// Package wire defines the small control-plane message set exchanged between a
// Vulos relay agent and the sovereign relay server over the WebSocket control
// connection, BEFORE yamux takes over the same net.Conn for request multiplexing.
//
// The handshake is a single JSON request/response:
//
//	agent  --> server : Register{Name, Token}
//	server --> agent  : RegisterAck{OK, PublicURL, Error}
//
// After a successful ack, both sides hand the connection to yamux: the server is
// the yamux *client* (it opens streams, one per inbound HTTP request); the agent
// is the yamux *server* (it accepts streams and proxies each to its one local
// target). Each stream carries a plain HTTP/1.1 request and response — no extra
// framing — so http.ReadRequest / Request.Write / http.ReadResponse can be used
// directly, which also gives us transparent WebSocket-upgrade passthrough.
