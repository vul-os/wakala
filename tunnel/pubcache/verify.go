// verify.go — THE MANDATORY GATE.
//
// Nothing enters this cache, and nothing leaves it, without passing Verify. That
// is the invariant the whole role rests on: a poisoned upstream MUST NOT become
// a poisoned cache. Because every § 22 read endpoint served here is
// content-addressed, "is this object authentic?" reduces entirely to "do these
// bytes hash to the address they were requested by?" — a question this node can
// answer alone, offline, with no key material, no DNS, and no trust in whoever
// handed it the bytes (§ 22.5.1: *a server is a convenience, not a trust root*).
//
// Verification runs BEFORE store and is re-run on the way out is unnecessary —
// bytes in the store are immutable and already proved — so the cost is paid once
// per object, on the miss path.
//
// Deliberately NOT handled here: `feed/{pub}/head`. A FeedHead is MUTABLE and
// is authenticated by an Ed25519 signature chaining through a DeviceCert, not by
// a content address, so this node cannot prove it correct with hashing alone.
// Rather than cache an object it cannot verify, this implementation takes
// § 22.5.1's other permitted path and does not cache feed heads at all — see
// service.go. Fail closed, always: an object this node cannot verify is an
// object it does not serve.

// Kind names the § 22.5.1 read endpoint an object was fetched from. Each kind
// has its own self-addressing rule.

//     address (0x0909; a sealed manifest fed here fails this by construction,

//     stores an object that disagrees with itself.
