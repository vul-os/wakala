// Package server is the sovereign Vulos relay: the public half of the reverse
// tunnel. It replaces a third-party frp server with our own, self-hostable relay.
//
// It runs TWO logical surfaces on one HTTPS listener:
//
//  1. Control endpoint (wire.ControlPath): agents dial in over wss, authenticate
//     with a bearer token, and register a token-authorized name. The server then
//     becomes the yamux CLIENT over that connection and opens one stream per
//     inbound public request.
//
//  2. Public proxy: inbound HTTPS requests are routed to an agent session by
//     subdomain (<name>.<relay-domain>, the primary mode, needs wildcard DNS) or by
//     path prefix (/t/<name>/…, the fallback when no wildcard DNS). Matched
//     requests are forwarded over a fresh yamux stream and the response streamed
//     back, including WebSocket-upgrade passthrough.
//
// The server is internet-facing and fails closed: no token store => refuses to
// run; unknown/unauthorized tokens are rejected; names cannot be hijacked; request
// sizes, header sizes, stream counts, and agent counts are all bounded.
